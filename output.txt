Midsummer














After the evening chores, after the smaller children were in bed,  
And a voice in the kitchen was always complaining about the heat, 
And for those two, it was terrible, as terrible as being alone.  
And for those who understood such things, the stars were sending messages:  
And the next day, we were kids again, sitting on the front steps in the morning,  
And then finally walk home through the fields,  
And then going to work, which meant helping out in the fields.  
And then the day faded. We were dreaming, waiting for night.  
And though sometimes you couldn’t see the person you were with, 
And you thought of  the boy or girl you’d be meeting later.  
And you thought of  walking into the woods and lying down,  
At the beginning and at the end, though, we were all together. 
But they’d show up anyway, as though some night their luck would change,  
On cloudy nights, you were blind. Those nights the rocks were dangerous,  
On nights like this we used to swim in the quarry,  
One boy worked for an old lady, building shelves.  
Standing at the front door at twilight, watching the shadows lengthen.  
The game was over. We’d sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes,  
The house was very old, maybe built when the mountain was built. 
The nights were humid, still. The stone was cool and wet, 
The summer night glowed; in the field, fireflies were glinting. 
The summer started. Then the boys and girls began to pair off  
Then the heat broke, the night was clear.  
You will leave the village where you were born  
and eventually you will return to seek it.
and in another country you’ll become very rich, very powerful, 
and the girls cooperating, because they had new bodies since last summer 
and the nights we wouldn’t. Once or twice, at the end of summer,  
and they wanted to exhibit them, the brave ones  
because there was always work the next day.

Mother and Child














And before that, the veiled world.
And before that: earth and water.
And before, cells in a great darkness.
Cells in a great darkness. Some machine made us;
Cells of my mother and father, it is your turn
I improvised; I never remembered.
Machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother’s body.
Machine of the mother: white city inside her.
Moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass.
Now it’s your turn to be driven;
Some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family.
Then back to the world, polished by soft whips.
This is why you were born: to silence me.
We dream; we don’t remember.
We’re all dreamers; we don’t know who we are.
Why do I suffer? Why am I ignorant?
it is your turn to address it, to go back asking
to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece.
